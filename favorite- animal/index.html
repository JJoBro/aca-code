   <h1>My Favorite Animal</h1>
   <p>Elephants is my favorite because it basically has 5 limbs. The African Savanna (Bush) elephant is the world's largest land animal – with adult males, or bull elephants, standing up to 3m high and weighing up to 6,000kg on average. Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that’s well over half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years. And it’s not just the adults – even calves are huge! At birth, a baby elephant can weigh 120kg - that’s almost 19 stone. There are three species of elephant: African Savanna (Bush), African Forest and Asian. The ears of African elephants are much larger than their cousins and are described as being shaped like the African continent, whereas the ears of Asian elephants are shaped like the Indian subcontinent. There’s also a trunk difference - African elephants have two ‘fingers’ at the tip of their trunks, whereas Asian elephants have one. </p>
